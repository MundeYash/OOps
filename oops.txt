4 Pillars of OOPs 

Encapulsation : 
It is the process of combining / warpping up of the data and functions into a single unit called class . 
It is useful in the data hiding : 

Abstraction : 



Constructor : 
It has same name as class , does not have any return type , automatically called at the time of object creation 
Memory allocation happens when the constructor is called 

Types of constructor : non-parameterised constructor , parameterised constructor , copy constructor 


constructor overloading is an example of polymorphism


this pointer in c++ 


copy constructor : It is a type of special constructor which is used to copy the properties of one object into the other object 


shallow copy: deals with making a copy of it and value to original object does not changes   and deep copy : it uses the concept of dynamic memory allocation and pointer and after making changes in the copy the original value also changes due to the pointer
